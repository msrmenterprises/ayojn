                                that they communicate with their children about their safety online,
                                as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive
                                service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</P>

                                            The Charges are the prices quoted on our site at the time you submit
                                            your registration.<BR><BR>13.3 If you wish to change the scope of
                                            the Website Services after we accept your registration, and we agree
                                            to such change, we will modify the Charges accordingly.<BR><BR>13.4
                                            We use our best efforts to ensure that the prices stated for the
                                            Website Services are correct at the time when the relevant
                                            information was entered into the system. However, please see clause
                                            7 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the

                                            usually by email if we do so. You undertake and agree to accept such
                                            notification by email and that any such notice sent in this manner
                                            constitutes a valid notice of variation in accordance with the

                                            7 It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some
                                            of the Website Services on our site may be incorrectly priced. If
                                            the correct price for the Website Services is higher than the price
                                            stated on our site, we will contact you as soon as possible to
                                            inform you of this error and we will give you the option of
                                            continuing to purchase the Website Services at the correct price or
                                            cancelling your registration. We will not process your registration
                                            until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you
                                            using the contact details you provided during the registration
                                            process, we will treat the registration as cancelled and notify you
                                            in writing. However, if we mistakenly accept and process your
                                            registration where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and
                                            could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may
                                            cancel supply of the Website Services and refund you any sums you
                                            have paid.
