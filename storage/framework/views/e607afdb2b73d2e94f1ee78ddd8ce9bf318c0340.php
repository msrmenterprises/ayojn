	</p>
	<br>
	<p>1. Sponsorship Index: This section of the web tells you about world-wide sponsorship spending by the users
		registered at <a href="<?php echo e(url('/')); ?>">Sponsay</a>.</p>
	<p>2. Opportunities: This tool is divided in two areas - </p>
	<p>A. Bid Opportunities -Created by the clients. The client will remain in a stealth mode unless they open your bid
		for
		negotiation.</p>
	<p>B. Build Opportunities- To be vouched by clients. You will remain in a stealth mode unless you open the vouch for
		negotiation.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Hope this helps you to engage with the clients and build a successful sponsorship program. Incase you need any
		assistance we are always around for a quick live chat (Chat button at the bottom right hand corner of the
		web).</p> -->
