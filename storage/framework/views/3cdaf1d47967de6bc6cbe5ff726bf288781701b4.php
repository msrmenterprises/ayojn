	</p>
	<br>
	<p>1. Sponsorship Index: This section of the web tells you about world-wide sponsorship spending by the users registered at <a href="<?php echo e(url('/')); ?>">Sponsay</a>.</p>
	<p>2. Opportunities: This tool is divided in two areas - </p>
	<p>A. <b>Create</b> Opportunities - To receive bids in a stealth mode unless you open the bid for negotiation.
	</p>
